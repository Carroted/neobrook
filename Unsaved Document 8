set up this elections system in typescript with node-cron for monthly elections:

month ID is like 202411 or 202501, we just do `(year * 100) + month` and then we can nicely store it like that and it sorts too
terms all have a month ID associated

we have a cronjob and on 24th of each month we switch to voting if not already in

and, each boot of the bot, we will check if between 24th of a month and 1st of next month, and start voting if we arent in voting yet

if we are in a term and its still its month ID, we just do nothing; cronjob for 24th will handle voting

and then theres cronjob for 1st of each month which tallies votes and starts new term, as long as there was an active vote that started at least 3 days ago. if it wasnt 3 days itll just wait (there will be an hourly check for that)

that same check will exist always but it wont happen until atleast the 1st of next month

if current month ID is not match current term and we arent in voting, start voting
